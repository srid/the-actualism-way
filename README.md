A **work-in-progress** summary[^meta] of the actualism method, based on my interactions with Richard & Vineeto during the [2024 Ballina Trip](https://twitter.com/sridca/status/1774121800080703874).

[^meta]: I use [OmniOutliner](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner/) to write this outline and generate HTML for it. Then, that HTML gets automatically published via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Things to do

- [x] Initial draft
- [ ] Finalize the summary
  - [ ] Did I miss any keypoints? Address them.
- [ ] Add links to the AFT website wherever appropriate
- [ ] ... anything else?

### Stretch goals

- [ ] Add favicon
- [ ] Write a better outline renderer
  - OmniOutliner has a few problems
    - In-document links navigation is not clear enough
    - No mobile-friendly view
